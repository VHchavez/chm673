COMPUTATIONAL QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
-------------------------------

CHM 673 - Spring 2020

**Course Description**    
This course aims to give the students both theoretical and practical background in the computational techniques used in modern quantum chemistry. A significant fraction of the student's time will be spent actually using quantum chemistry programs. The last assignment will provide a chance for students to perform an independent computational project related to their research interest and present a seminar to the class A solid undergraduate backbfound in Physical Chemistry or, preferably, Quantum Mechanics, will suffice as a prerequisite. 

**Topics Covered**    
- Preliminaries: central approximations and important concepts in modeling
- Self-consistent field theory
- Density functional theory
- Potential energy surfaces and chemical reactions
- Achieving chemical accuracy 
-Electronically excited an open-shell species
-Introduction to modeling chemistry of extended systems
